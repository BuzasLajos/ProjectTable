When list pictures, check if that src exists in img_compress_20 folder
If exists show the compressed image
else show the original pictures

Image compressing is manual now, do it server-side automatically (if the image is large)

Admin UI
	Login, create folder, upload files
	add projects and create tables (edit the table.txt in the src folder)

Recognize file types and show icons (pdf, zip, rar, etc.)

Vertical/Horisontal images can't show properly

Info button clicked, but src dowsn't exist --> echo "Feltöltés alatt"

Problem: If the project table is built from a txt file,
	Google robots can find the content of the webpage?
	
table("src/palyazatok.txt", "Pályázatok");
	Page can't load if palyazatok.txt dowsn't exist
